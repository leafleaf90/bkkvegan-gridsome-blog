*The sad truth about the state of our oceans and the industrial fishing.*
<br/><br/>

![Let's look at some of the problems with the industrial fishing industry.](./images/overfishing/1.jpg)
![The depletion of fish in our oceans due to overfishing is staggering. Source: Myers RA, Worm B. Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities. Nature. 2003; 423: 280-283.](./images/overfishing/2.jpg)
![The oceans are maxed out since long ago, and the amount of farmed fish is increasing to meet global demand. Source: Food & Agriculture Organization of the United States. (2020). The state of world fisheries and aquaculture.](./images/overfishing/3.jpg)
![Bycatch is when species other than the targeted species is caught and usually discarded. Bottom trawling is the main offender.](./images/overfishing/4.jpg)
![With longline fishing, a lot of birds are also among the bycatch.](./images/overfishing/5.jpg)
![Farmed fish (aquaculture) is not the solution. It still takes a lot of wild-caught fish to feed the salmon, for example.](./images/overfishing/6.jpg)
![The best way to save the fish is to not kill the fish. A plantbased diet is the number one solution to save our collapsing ecosystems.](./images/overfishing/7.jpg)
